## Go.Data ESRI SITREP Toolbox (version 1.0)
This is a python toolbox for use in ArcGIS Pro (2.6.3, 2.7.1, 2.8.3) to extract, transform and map data. Go.Data is an application which facilitates outbreak investigation, including field data collection, contact tracing, and visualization of chains of transmission. This toolbox was created to allow someone in the GIS role of outbreak emergency response to access the outbreak data from within ArcGIS Pro, and process the data to generate multiple SITREP maps. The tool automates these tasks and limits the need to learn the outbreak management database system. More information about this toolbox is located on the Go.Data github documentation site [here](https://worldhealthorganization.github.io/godata/arcgis-pro/).
